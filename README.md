Starcraft II replay hoster for Google App Engine
================================================

This is a tiny Google App Engine project that powers
[http://sc2share.com/](http://sc2share.com/), a site that stores Starcraft II
replay files under tiny, bit.ly-like URLs. This is meant as an alternative to
the ad-ridden, registration-required, bloated replay websites.

The website if online and it does work, feel free to use it. Do notice however
that I no longer play Starcraft II. This was just an arbitrary project to learn
about GAE.

If anything, this could be useful as an introduction to the GAE's BlobStore.

The sharded counter implementation included here comes from GAE's
documentation. Please refer to original docs if you are interested.
